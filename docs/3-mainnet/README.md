# Mainnet Metachain Guide

In this tutorial, we will guide you through setting up a subchain with one validator, and connect it to the [Main Chain of the Theta Mainnet](https://explorer.thetatoken.org/).

We provide two options, namely the **manual flow** and the **wizard flow** for launching a Subchain for the Mainnet. The manual flow is similar to the process for configuring a local Metachain Privatenet, where the user needs to setup the environment manually through the command line interface. Alternatively, you may launching a subchain through the "launch wizard" web interface we provide.

* **Option 1**. Manual Flow

  * **Step 1**. [Setting up the Testnet Environment](./manual-flow/1-setup.md)

  * **Step 2**. [Subchain Registration and Staking](./manual-flow/2-register-and-staking.md)

  * **Step 3**. [Cross-chain Asset Transfers](./manual-flow/3-cross-chain-asset-transfers.md)

* **Option 2**. Wizard Flow

  * Please check out [this guide](./wizard-flow/1-wizard-flow.md) for more details.
